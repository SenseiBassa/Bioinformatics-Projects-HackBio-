        "\n",
        "Remember, the process of genome sequencing simply entails chopping down the over 3 billion nucleotide bases down into chunks of 30-100 bases. So, the data we actually get is fragments. Now, we want to reassemble the genome from these chunks.\n",
        "If there’s a high-quality reference genome for the species (which we will do later on), you can map these reads to it and be done. But often, there is no reference — either because the species has never been sequenced, or because you expect major differences (new genes, structural rearrangements) that mapping might miss.\n",
        "De novo assembly solves this problem by building the genome from scratch. It’s the genetic equivalent of solving a jigsaw puzzle without knowing the final picture. This is critical for:\n",
        "\n",
        "Novel species discovery — sequencing non-model organisms.\n",

        "Evolutionary studies — comparing fully assembled genomes across species.\n",
        "\n",
        "Structural variant detection — finding large insertions, deletions, and rearrangements missed by mapping approaches.\n",

        "In this module, we will be covering specifics applications in organism detection and pathogen tracking.\n",
