        "As we navigate the vast expanse of genomic data, the next crucial step in our journey is genome mapping—a process that aligns raw sequencing reads to a reference genome. Genome mapping is the compass that guides us through the intricacies of genomic landscapes, allowing us to decipher the genomic coordinates of individual reads.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Problem:\n",
        "Imagine your raw sequencing reads as puzzle pieces scattered across a table, each representing a fragment of the biological story encoded in the DNA. The challenge lies in piecing together these fragments accurately, ensuring that they align with the reference genome in a meaningful and biologically relevant manner. Failure to address this alignment challenge can introduce errors, misalignments, and ultimately lead to skewed interpretations of the genomic narrative.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Need for Genome Mapping:\n",
        "Genome mapping is the critical bridge that connects raw sequencing reads to the known blueprint of a reference genome. It's analogous to reading a map—a precise and accurate alignment ensures that we correctly identify the genomic location of each read, allowing us to navigate the vast genomic landscape with confidence. A well-executed genome mapping step is foundational for downstream analyses such as variant calling, structural variant identification, and functional annotation.\n",
        "So, let's embark on this journey of genomic navigation and discover how genome mapping serves as the key to unlocking the wealth of information embedded in our DNA. Welcome to the Genome Mapping section of the Genomics Data Analysis Pipeline Course!\n",
